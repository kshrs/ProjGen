**ProjGen** is a **Simple Generative AI Chat Bot** designed to help students in colleges and universities kickstart projects in their field of interest.  
This project runs locally on your machine but **connects to Google's cloud-based Gemini Flash 2.0 model** through the `google.generativeai` library. All interactions are powered by **Gemini Flash 2.0**, giving you fast, context-aware, and intelligent project ideation support.  

ProjGen offers both **CLI (Command Line Interface)** and **Web Interface** options to suit different user preferences.

├── genai.py                         # Main CLI chatbot and core AI functions
├── .history.db                      # SQLite database for chat history

└── db_manip.py                      # Database manipulation functions
```

**Note:** The `views.py` file serves as the bridge that connects the core AI functions in `genai.py` with both the Django backend and frontend interface.

## API Key Setup  
This project requires a valid **Google API Key** to access Gemini models.  
1. Obtain your API Key from **Google AI Studio**.  
2. Create a file named `.api_key.txt` in the project's root directory.  
3. Paste your API Key inside this file **without adding any extra text, spaces, or lines**.  
Example:  
```
AIzaSyD9-your-api-key-here
```
